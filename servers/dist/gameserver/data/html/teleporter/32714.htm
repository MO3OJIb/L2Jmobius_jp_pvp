<html><body>Gatekeeper Aisher:<br>
For thousands of years, Primeval Isle had been sealed to prevent its inhabitants from leaving through this Gate. Now, however, adventurers' activities seem to have finally weakened the seal enough to permit departures. You may teleport to the mainland, but only to Rune Township. Would you like to do so?<br>
