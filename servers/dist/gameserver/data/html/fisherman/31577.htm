<html><body>Fishing Guild Member Linnaeus:<br>
Did you know? Our king also likes fishing very much. It is the pride of us Fishermen`s guild members. The king possesses superb fishing skills to boot!<br>
Oh, I am Linnaeus, Fishermen`s Guild member. Aden Castle Town has many great places to fish. When we have beautiful weather, why don`t you take some time off and go enjoy some fishing? Won`t it give you the air of an aristocrat? Ha Ha Ha Ha!<br>
