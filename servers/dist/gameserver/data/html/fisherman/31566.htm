Do you know how to fish? If you want to learn, I can teach you. There's nothing as fun and relaxing as fishing. Highly-stressed people like you need some time alone, or perhaps to be with a few friends in a quiet place like this. Oh, by the way, if you catch more fish than you can handle, bring them to me!<br>
