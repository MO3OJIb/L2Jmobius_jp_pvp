<html><body>Subclass/Dual Class Certificate Manager Trandon:<br>
If your subclass is strong enough, that class' power can be transferred to your main class.<br><br>
But this is a dangerous feat. Your power must be proven through certification.<br><br>
If you have a certificate, I will do a partial transfer on you.<br><br>
Now, will you learn the subclass skills transferred onto the main class?<br><br>
