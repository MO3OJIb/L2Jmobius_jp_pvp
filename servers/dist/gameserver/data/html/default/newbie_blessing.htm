The Blessing of Protection is available to *characters under level 39 who have not completed* their second class transfer. Protected by its power, *you cannot receive damage from (or inflict damage to)* chaotic characters who are 10+ levels above you. It will not protect you on the battlefield, however. Would you like to receive the Blessing of Protection now?<br>
