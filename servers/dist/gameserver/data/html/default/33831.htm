Have you heard of the *Orc Supervia*?<br>
When our orc kingdom collapsed, they fought against the *Noble Orcs*. Currently, they don't belong to the orc coalition and work independently.<br>
Their anti-orc behavior is troubling.<br>
Worse, they have uniflied various other tribes into their anti-*Noble Orc* agenda. They're now powerful than any other individual tribe.<br>
I'm certain they're plotting something.
