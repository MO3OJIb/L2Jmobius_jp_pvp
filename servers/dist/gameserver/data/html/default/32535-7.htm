<html><body>Destroyed Tumor:<br>
Long, narrow passages that look like blood vessels form a web of connections among the tumors. Given the almost suffocating aura of death and decay pulsing through the passages, the other side of the passage must be the core heart, where Ekimus sleeps. Other passages lead to <font color="LEVEL">another destroyed tumor in the area</font>. <font color="LEVEL">If you challenge Ekimus now, others inside the core heart will be expelled by his fury.</font><br>
