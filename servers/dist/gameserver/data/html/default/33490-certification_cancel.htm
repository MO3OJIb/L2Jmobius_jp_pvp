<html><body>Subclass/Dual Class Certificate Manager Trandon:<br><br>
Subclass skill certification and learning actually require tons of effort. Not just effort - it's more fundamental than that. The enormous pressure it puts on your soul... a normal person wouldn't be able to survive it.<br><br>
Not that it's completely impossible if you use special herbs. Except that those herbs cost about <font color="LEVEL"><?COST?> million Adena</font> each. But i have the herbs handy, so as long as you pay up, I can cancel that certification for you.<br><br>
If you cancel the certification, <font color="LEVEL">your current certification status disappears, and all certificates and sealbooks you didn't learn skills will be deleted.</font> So... what do you want to do?<br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_subclass_CertificationCancel_true">"Oh, story of my life. Whatever, I'm canceling the certification."</Button><br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 9">"Whoa, what? Wait a sec..."</Button>
