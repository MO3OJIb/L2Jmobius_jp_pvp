<html><body>Mouth of Ekimus:<br>
As if they're the flames that have been put out, the low moaning sound from falling souls spreads over the other side of the gap. It seems to be a passage to *Hall of Erosion* where the souls are sucked into Ekimus and part of Seed of Immortality. (Hall of Erosion is an instant zone exclusively for command channel where minimum 18 and maximum 27 people can enter.)<br>
