Tell me what you want, and if you are worthy I will help you. If you have already *bestowed them with a special ability*, *top-grade weapons and armor* can be enhanced *beyond A-Grade* especially for PvP combat. Once a multi-user item is specialized, you will still be able to enchant the item. However, you cannot refine, crystallize, convert or add an attribute to it. Think carefully before making a decision...<br>
