How do you do? Allow me to introduce myself. I am Sobling, an archaeologist. I put together the puzzles of the past and discover the truth. They call me grandpa at home, but when I start a new project my heart pounds like it's my first excavation!<br>
I am particularly excited about my upcoming exploration of the Cave of Giants.<br>
