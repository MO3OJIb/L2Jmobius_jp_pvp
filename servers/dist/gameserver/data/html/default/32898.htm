Look at these beautiful buildings! They're fantastic! How'd our ancestors build these things? Amazing! Our Gray Pillar guild is trying to find more relics of our ancestors' superior technologies.<br><br>
From wwhat we"ve seen so far, it appears that rhe Ancient City Arcan was created by Elves, Dwarves, and the chosen of God. According to some current theories, our ancestor's filled the building with warmth and life by using Glimmer. Glimmer is abundant here, but quantitative validaty research is still underway!<br><br>
