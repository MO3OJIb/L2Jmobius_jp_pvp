<html><body>Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>
I am Theodric, the watchful eye over Earth Dragon Antharas <br>
I watch every movement made by that cursed Shilen's creature, even in slumber... it is a lonely fate, but I have gicen my body and soul to this sacred duty, even when it meant selling my soul to darkness to become an immortal Undead.<br>
Even if you enter this cave, you cannot reach Antharas' net. The entrance has been tightly shut by the Guardians of the Seals. If you wich to enter, use a Portal Stone to activate the Heart of Warding.<br>
