<html><body>Richard:<br>Hello. I'm Richard, a Gatekeeper here on Talking Island. Is this your first time here? Then please, explore the island! Enjoy its quirks! I should mention though that my skills only allow me to teleport you to different areas on Talking Island including Ye Sagira Ruins--but <font color="LEVEL">only after you've been there yourself</font>.<br>
If you want to go to Aden continent, go find <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Milia</font> near the Training Grounds and Museum.<br>
