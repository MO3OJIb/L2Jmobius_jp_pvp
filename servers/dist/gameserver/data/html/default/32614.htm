This is the pier for Gludio Airships. Airships headed for the continent of Gracia also arrive and depart from here. We tap into a strong aura of power and depend on favorable winds to allow the Airships to travel such a far distance. if you're not ready to leave for Gracia yet, you'd best go back.<br>
