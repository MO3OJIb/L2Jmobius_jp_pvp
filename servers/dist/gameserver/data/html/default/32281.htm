<html><body>Oracle Guide:<br>
A mysterious five-colored whirlwind swirls within an aquamarine sphere, and you hear a clear, cultured voice. Welcome. I am the first child of the Oracle. My mistress ia *Parme*, the Shamaness of the Water Dragon. She is currently under the enemy's control, but an Oracle led me to this place just before she was captured. <br1>
My mission is to safely escort you to her current location. Unfortunately, that place is unreachable without proper preparation. If you are ready, please give me your hand, and I shall open the way.<br>
