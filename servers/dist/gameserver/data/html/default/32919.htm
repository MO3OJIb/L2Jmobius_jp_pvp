<html><body>Cocoon:<br>
Through the thin membrane can be seen as a fairy mutates. It seems that you can break the cocoon by hitting it. And you can pour in <font color="LEVEL">Slude</ font>, and thus force the mutation. (To use <font color="LEVEL">Slude</ font>, choose Cocoon and click on mica. If you want to break the cocoon, hit it, hold down the &quot;Ctrl&quot;. To improve stroke using attack skills.)<br>
