In order to seal or unseal the Power Shirt, you must have a *Power Shirt or a Sealed Power Shirt in the character's inventory.* <br1>
A Sealed Power Shirt can be transferred to another character within the account through the Dimensional Merchant. *But, when the seal is removed on a Sealed Power Shirt, you can no longer use seal/unseal.*<br>
