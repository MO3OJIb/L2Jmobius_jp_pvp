<html><body>Dimensional Merchant:<br>
Hello!<br1>
We are the *Dumensional Merchants*, a shot in the arm for all of Aden's hardy travelers! <br1>
We endeavor to make your time in Aden more enjoyable! <br1>
You can retrieve a Dimensional Item that you have bought from the L2 Galleria.<br1>
If your inventory weight is 80% or more and/or you do not have enough room in your inventory, you will not be able to retrieve your Dimensional Item. Please be careful as some items can't be traded once you have claimed! <br1>
Have a great time!<br>
