Welcome! Thank you for visiting our warehouse! We promise to always treat our customers like family! Do you have heavy items or precious items you're reluctant to take on your travels?<br>
Ah, no worries! Simply deposit them with us and I give you my word that though the foundations of the world be shaken, your property will be safe. (Uh, in the improbable case of loss, I, Benis, will reimburse you fully for your loss.)<br>
