You who seek divine truth, welcome to the Temple of Einhasad. Currently, Giran has never had such peace and abundance. However, in these times we must guard against the throngs of darkness that would seek to corrupt the souls of good people. The magic of light that the Gods have allowed us to share must be used to punish these dark powers. This is our destiny!<br>
