<html><body>Feed Seller:<br>
Welcome to the Beast Farm! Anyone can raise a beast in this place. If you are lucky, that beast will then tamely follow you. If you are not so lucky, well...you better hope you can defeat the creature!<br>
Anyway, I sell feed for beasts here: *Golden Spice* and *Crystal Spice*. Golden Spice helps beasts grow larger, while Crystal Spice helps bones and skins become tougher. If you want a beast to become rich, feed it Golden Spice. If you want to raise it strong, feed it Crystal Spice. Why not buy both and compare their effects?<br>
