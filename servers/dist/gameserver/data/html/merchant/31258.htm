Errrh...!!! Huh? A customer?! Sorry, I was moving some loads in the back and didn't hear you come in... You need armor, eh? Well, have a look around! We used to carry some of the finest armor in the whole region. Now that the north is so troubled, though, it's as easy to get actual Dwarven items as plucking a star from the sky. Such a pity...<br>
