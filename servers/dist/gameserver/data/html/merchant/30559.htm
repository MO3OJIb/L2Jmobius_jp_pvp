By the eternal glory of the flame! Greetings, friend. I am Kunai. All the weaponry I sell here was crafted by Dwarves; its quality is without peer. True, the Dwarves are a stunted and laughable race, but you cannot deny their skill. There is no shame in using their labor to further our glory, is there? Look around and choose something worthy of your heritage.<br>
