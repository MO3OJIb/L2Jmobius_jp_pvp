Congratulations on your safe return, young soldier! Word has come that the tower has become a chaotic entanglement of angels and demons. I trust that you have recovered many of the *Ancient Ash Urns* from Hallate's warriors, knights and commanders!<br>
The *Ancient Porcelain* you brought doesn't contain any remains. It was only used for decoration! It's no good to me, you can keep it for yourself! Either sell it at a store or take it to *antique dealer Patrin*! He is at the general store in Oren Castle Town.<br>
