If you pass through all rooms, the *2 corrupted Death Knights, Yehan Klodekus and Yehan Klanikus*, will be waiting in the last room. Your mission is a success if you defeat these two. Remember that they are spiritually connected to each other, so *unless you kill them at the same time, they will soon resurrect*. Don't forget!<br>
It you cannot defeat these 2 Death Knights within the prescribed time limit, or if all your members are killed, your mission wil have failed. Remember too that you can only undertake this mission once per day. Even if you abandon the battle in the middle of the mission, you will have to wait one full day before trying again. Do you understand?<br>
