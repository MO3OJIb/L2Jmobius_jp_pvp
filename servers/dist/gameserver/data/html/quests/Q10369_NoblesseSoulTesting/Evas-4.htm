Adventured!You have brought all ingredients!Thank you so much!I was worried I1d never be able to purify the water!<br>
I'd like to repay you for your trouble,but the reward I give is not something that everyone can receive.The weak will be killed by my gift. I would like to test your spirit first.<br>
