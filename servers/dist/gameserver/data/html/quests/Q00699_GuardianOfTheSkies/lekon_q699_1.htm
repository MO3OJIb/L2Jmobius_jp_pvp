<html><body>Engineer Lekon I'm searching for an adventurer who can defeat the Master Rider which wanders around the area and pirating, attacks soldiers who are coming back from the mission. Kill Master Rider in order to completely eliminate the problem instead of catching his subordinate, Vulture Riders... I will reward you for every killed monster.<br>
