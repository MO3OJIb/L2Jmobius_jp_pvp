(Hardin draws something and begins writing in the empty Book of Seal. Once finished, he casts some sort of spell on the Book of Sealm which flashes for a moment.)<br>
Now take this Book of Seal to *Avant-Garde, the Transformation Wizard* on the 2nd floor of the *Ivory Tower* and you should be able to effect a transformation. My thanks - you are a valuable assistant!<br>
Since I'm as generous as I'm brilliant, I also wish you to take this... Now I can plunge myself into research for a more varied kind of Transformation magic. Farewell!
