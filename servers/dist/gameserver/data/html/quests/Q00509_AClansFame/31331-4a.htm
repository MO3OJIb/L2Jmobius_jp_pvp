Too bad! I need you to slaughter *Demon's Agent Falston* and bring me his Fang!<br>
*As I told you before, you don't have to kill him yourself!* There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Demon's Agent Falston and then bring his Fang to me.<br>
