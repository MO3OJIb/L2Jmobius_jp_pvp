Too bad! I need you to slaughter *Daimon the White-Eyed* and bring me his Eyes!<br>
*As I told you before, you don't have to kill her yourself!* There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Daimon the White-Eyed and then bring his Eyes to me.<br>
