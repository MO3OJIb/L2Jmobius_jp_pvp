By the looks of you, I can tell you aren't one of the locals... given the fact you can still stand up straight and don't look like you are about to pass out. I'm a talent scout and I'm looking for the best of the best in Aden. Apparently, I made a mistake coming here first. You look like you know your way around a weapon. Want to test your skills?<br>
