I'll give you the words of the Warehouse Worker Valderala of Aden. Listen to me, O traveler!<br>
Valderal says that he decided to start a new business, but ran into some difficulties. He said that would be very grateful if you'll do him a little help... Oh, do not frown!
Of course, it is not limited to words of gratitude and give rewards.<br>
