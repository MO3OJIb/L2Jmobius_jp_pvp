<html><body>Guard Latson:<br>
If you follow the road that lies before me to the east, you can easily arrive at the *Bazaar of Giran.* One thing you must remember is to be on your guard when you pass the *Execution Ground,* about halfway there. That place is crawling with evil undead. May the divine protection of Einhasad surround you.<br>
