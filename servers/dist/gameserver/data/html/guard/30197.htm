<html><body>Guard Heiac:<br>
Be quiet! I am not allowed to talk while I'm on duty! Furthermore, the captain is standing right next to me... Hmmph, ok well. I'll tell you briefly. Here, the town of Oren is close to the borders, so we must never let our guard down. Nevertheless, we have been told unofficially to always watch a certain tower. That is the *Ivory Tower* of course.<br>
