Be careful! This place is very crowded because of construction on the village wall. Wooden props may collapse or bricks may fall, so be on alert. Many are experiencing discomfort due to the construction. In particular, the Traders from *Giran* have many complaints. I hope the construction is finished quickly so that the travelers can enter the village through a proper gate.<br>
