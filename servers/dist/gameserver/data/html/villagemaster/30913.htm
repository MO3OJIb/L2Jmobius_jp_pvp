Welcome to the Heine, the city of water... Eh, the truth is that Orcs like me just can't get used to a city like this, with its white and shiny buildings and candy-stinking Elves. I feel like firecracker thrown into a pond.<br>
But duty calls, and we do what must be done... So, why are you looking for me?<br>
