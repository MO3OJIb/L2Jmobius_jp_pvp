<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
Welcome to the Town of Aden, the heart of the kingdom. People speak of this place as the kingdom's cultural and religious center. If this is true, then this sanctuary of life is truly the apex of faith that all who serve Einhasad must preserve...<br>
But true holiness may also be found in the ordinary, the everyday, the mundane. The prayer of a commoner may resonate more deeply with the mother of light than even the prayer of a high priest, so perhaps this place is not so different from other temples.<br>
