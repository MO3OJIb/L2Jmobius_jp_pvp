<html><body>High Prefect Castor:<br>
I, High Prefect Castor, teach Orcs by the authority of Pa'agrio, the father of eternal fire. It is my duty to help ensure that we may once more attain the glory of our illustrious ancestors. You, young Orc warrior, you are like a tinderbox whose spark, though small, becomes a great blaze! In you I see the hope that will revive the trampled pride of our Orc tribe. How may I be of service to you?<br>
