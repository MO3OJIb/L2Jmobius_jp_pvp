Kreuk! Oh... my head hurts... It must be true what they say about the wine merchants putting spider venom in Dreviant wine. Curse those friends! Damn... I was lucky enough to have some delivered from the Dreviant village, but that Cedric must have drunk three bottles by himself...! That old Dwarvish geezer! Desmo! You are no better! Are you planning on taking over the world with your ability to drink?<br>
Huh? Oh! Welcome to the Magicians Guild of the Town of Aden. I am Grand Master Drikiyan. Who are you?<br>
